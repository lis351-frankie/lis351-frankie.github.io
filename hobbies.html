<dt style="color:#009200;">Swimming</dt>
<dd style="color:#009200;">From the moment I dipped into the water at the age of 5yrs old, swimming became more than just a hobby â€“ it became a passion that has stayed with me throughout my life. Moving near the ocean in California, I found solace in its vastness and tranquility. One vivid memory that stands out is the exhilarating experience of swimming half a mile across a lake. Whether it's the rhythmic strokes in a pool or the freedom of swimming in open water of a river, lake, or ocean, there's an indescribable sense of peace and connection that I find in the water.</dd>

<dt style="color:#009200;">Tennis</dt>
<dd style="color:#009200;">On the other hand, entered my life through structured lessons, where I discovered a natural talent that I never knew existed. The sport's blend of strategy, skill, and athleticism captivated me from the start. Every match is a test of endurance and determination, pushing me to improve and refine my technique with each swing of the racket.</dd>

<dt style="color:#009200;">Rock climbing</dt>
<dd style="color:#009200;">A relatively recent addition to my hobbies, was introduced to me by my twin sister. The thrill of scaling the side of a cliff or artificial wall and the rush of adrenaline as I reach the summit are unmatched experiences that push me beyond my comfort zone and ignite my spirit of adventure, while also helping me to get in my sustained amount of cardio.</dd>

<dt style="color:#009200;">Listening to music</dt>
<dd style="color:#009200;">Music serves as the backdrop to my life, providing a soundtrack for every moment and emotion. Whether it's the soothing melodies that accompany my morning walks or the upbeat tunes that energize me during workouts, music has a way of lifting my spirits and transporting me to another world.</dd>
