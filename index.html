My name is Frankie Glave, and I was born in the city of London, England. Growing up in the heart of England's capital, I was surrounded by a vibrant mix of cultures and experiences that helped shape my worldview from an early age.

At the age of 14yrs old, my life took a significant turn when my family decided to move across the Atlantic to the sunny shores of Los Angeles, California. It was a big adjustment, leaving behind London, but it opened up a world of opportunities and experiences that I will forever cherish.


Currently, I am embarking on a new chapter of my life as a freshman at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Business Associate degree with a focus on finance. I've always been fascinated by the world of business, and I'm excited to learn more about finance and how it shapes the world around us</p>

		<p style="color:deeppink">Growing up, I developed a passion for staying active and exploring the great outdoors. Whether it's swimming in the Ocean or a pool, playing a noncompetitive game of tennis with friends, immersing myself in the rhythms of music, or conquering new heights through rock climbing, I thrive on the adrenaline rush and sense of accomplishment that comes with pushing my limits. </p>
